#### Web project from "The Complete Javascript Course 2023" (from Udemy) 
---

### This site is designed to help you find a perfect recipe of any dish you choose ðŸ“Œ
---
### Description:
This project is connected to a third-party API with over 1 000 000 recipes. 

You can search a perfect one by simply typing the clue word in the search bar above. On finding a recipe, you will see its cooking time, servings, ingredients, and a link to source with detailed instructions for the cooking process. It should be mentioned, that the servings on each recipe are mutable: you are able to increase or decrease them. As the result the quantity of ingredients will also vary. 

Another functionality is that you can bookmark the recipe, so it will appear in your bookmark panel aftewards. All the bookmarks are stored in your local storage, so you can access them even after reloading the page. 

Apart from all of that, you can add your own recipe, which will be visible only by you. To do so click an **"Add recipe"** icon in the top right corner, add details, attach a cool picture, and post the recipe.
